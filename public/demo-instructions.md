<!-- Demo Instructions -->

If you want to test the app but don't have a family photo handy, you can:

1. Find a family photo online (make sure to respect copyright)
2. Use a stock photo website like Unsplash or Pexels
3. Search for "family photo" or "parents with children"
4. Make sure the photo has:
   - Clear, visible faces
   - At least 2 people (ideally parents and children)
   - Good lighting
   - Front-facing poses work best

Some good search terms:
- "family portrait"
- "parents with kids"
- "family of four"
- "mother father children"

Remember: All processing happens locally in your browser, so your photos are never uploaded anywhere!
